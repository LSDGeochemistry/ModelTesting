Scripts for testing aspects of the LSDMixingModel.

These include

. Some scripts (in cosmo_production_scripts) testing the LSDMixingModel cosmo code against analytical soultion from existing papers.
.. 'CRN_production_w_depth.py`: Calculates cosmogenic production with depth using equation 20 from  https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article/47/1/731/235418/cosmic-ray-produced-noble-gases-in-terrestrial[Niedermann, 2002].
.. 'CRN_production_w_depth_full_mixing.py`: Calculates cosmogenic production with depth (fully mixed) using equation A1 from  https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/0012821X9400249X[Brown et al, 1995].
.. 'CRN_production_w_depth_erosion_lal.py`: Calculates cosmogenic production with depth incorporating erosion using equation 11 from  https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0012821X05003419[Lal and Chen, 2005].
.. 'CRN_production_w_depth_mixing_depth_brown.py`: Calculates cosmogenic production with depth incorporating mixing using equation 5 from  https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/0012821X9400249X[Brown et al, 1995]. (needs updating)
.. 'CRN_production_w_depth_mixing_erosion_lal.py`: Calculates cosmogenic production with depth incorporating mixing using equation 13 from  https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0012821X05003419[Lal and Chen, 2005]. note the erratum equation is used instead of the incorrect one within the paper.
.. 'CRN_production_from_output.py': A script for plotting various data derived from the LSDMixingModel code
. Some work in progress scripts for visualising output from the model with particular focus on hillslopes. Currently only has a folder for catena scripts, others may follow
.. 'Catena_plotter.py': a script for plotting the soil thickness on a catena profile
.. 'Crn_catena_output.py': a script for plotting and comparing profiles down a hillslope
.. 'Crn_catena_output_stats.py': a script for extracting various stats for the hillslope
. Within the cosmo_testing_runs folder are test runs and output files for the 4 test scenarios as follows, these can be verified using the appropriate cosmo testing script.
.. Run1 : no erosion and no mixing.
.. Run2 : no erosion but full mixing.
.. Run3 : erosion but no mixing.
.. Run4 : erosion and full mixing.
. Within the master_param folder are details for creating new parameter files and folders to loop through. Also here are the master parameter files used to test the model against the profiles in https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JF000921[Scahller et al, 2009].
.. The crn_run_output_vs files contains data for plotting the model data against the data in https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JF000921[Schaller et al, 2009].
.. 'Crn_file_looper.py': possibly need renamed but a scripot to plot all the cosmo data for multiple runs on a single plot.
. 'numerical_hillslope_solution.py': Tests the sediment flux and hillslope soil depth evolution.
. 'flowtube_creator.py': a python script of obtaining flowtube parameters from a DEM and transect data, work in progress.
. 'run_directory_executor.py': a simple script using subprocess to run a model run for every folder within a subfolder using the mixing model.
